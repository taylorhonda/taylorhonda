					Hello! I'm a junior at UC Berkeley, originally from Los Angeles. I'm currently majoring in sociology, but also exploring the worlds of design and web development. Although prior to taking the Web Design Decal I had no experience with web development, the class helped me learn many awesome things - like hover effects and click functionality. I am so proud of everything I have learned, but of course, I still have a lot to learn. 
					My experience with design first began in high school when I worked for a newspaper. I then went on to join The Daily Californian and Innovative Design, where I expanded on what I learned in high school and picked up new skills. If you'd like to chat, well I don't drink coffee, but I'm always down for tea! 
					<div id="fact"> Random fact: I have a secret ability to turn invisible; try clicking on me to the left! Haha okay, maybe I just needed to use JQuery functions.</div>
